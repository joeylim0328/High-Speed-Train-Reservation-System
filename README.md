# Implementation details
The data structure that we use in our program are **linked list**, **queue**, and **bubble sort**.
1. Linked list  
In our high-speed train reservation system, we create two linked list, which are lists of customer and reference. For the linked list of customers, we have a \*next pointer in every customer node that points to the next node. In a customer node, there will be the personal details of the customer, seat number and the \*next pointer. For the linked list of reference, there will be the details of the customers after making transactions, reference number and a \*next pointer. We choose linked list over arrays to make both of the lists because it is easier to do any insertions or deletions at any point in the list. In arrays, we can only put one type of data type, but in linked list, we can insert a collection of different data types in a node such as string for first name and integer for age. So, to access the details of the customer, users have to key in the reference number, and the program will have a \*curr pointer to search from the beginning of the list to get the details of the customer.

2. Queue  
Queue is used using pointers. Once we have added a customer in the program, the program will enqueue the customer in the linked list of reference that contains the transaction (buy ticket, edit details, delete details) of all of the customers. We also have a dequeue function that will dequeue the transactions before we exit the program to clear out the memory in the program. We use queue in our program because it operates in a First In First Out context. Queue can enqueue the customer’s references in ascending order and dequeue them ascendingly when the program is terminated.

3. Bubble sort  
For the sort function, we have implemented bubble sort in our program. In the sortCustomer() function, we will sort the customer based on their seat numbers. For example, if Customer A chooses seat 3 first and Customer B chooses seat 2 after that, the sort function will swap their positions to make sure Customer B is before Customer A. We choose bubble sort because it is easier to implement and understand.

# Screenshot
### Interface of program
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_1.PNG?raw=true)
This system only has one type of user, which is the person who is using the kiosk. The four functions that the user can use are:
- Purchase train ticket
- Cancel reservation
- Modify ticket information
- Display ticket details

### Sample input & output
1. If the user chooses the 'buy ticket' option, the system will show a list of the available train services. The user can then choose the train service that they want by entering the alphabet (A/B/C in this case).
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_2.png?raw=true)

2. After entering the user's train of choice, the user is prompted to enter personal details (name, age, ID number).
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_3.png?raw=true)

3. The user is then prompted to choose a seat. There are three choices, first class, business class and economy class. The system shows the user which seat is occupied/booked by others. In this case, train A has no passenger yet, so the user can choose any seat.
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_4.png?raw=true)

4. After choosing the seat, a summary of the booking is shown. A reference number is given to user for further usage (explained later). If the user wants to buy more tickets, press Y. If the user decides to return to the main menu, press N.
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_5.png?raw=true)

5. If the user chooses the 'cancel reservation' option, the user is asked to pay an extra fee to cancel the reservation. The user is then prompted to key in the train booked and the reference number.
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_6.png?raw=true)

6. The system shows a summary to show that the user has cancelled the booking. This seat number is intentionally set to 99 to show that the booking is cancelled. 
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_7.png?raw=true)

7. If the user chooses the 'modify ticket information' option, the user is prompted to key in the train details followed by the reference number. The user can then choose to edit either the first name, last name, age, ID or seat.
![screenshot1](/Screenshots/ss_8.png?raw=true)

8. If the user chooses the 'display ticket details' option, the reference number has to be entered followed by the train that is booked by the user. The details of the booking will then be shown.
